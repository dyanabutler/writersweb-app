-- This script will be run after a user signs up to create their first story
-- Note: This is just an example - in practice, you'd run this via your app

-- Insert a sample story (this would be done via your app after user signup)
-- INSERT INTO public.stories (user_id, title, author, genre, description)
-- VALUES (
--   auth.uid(),
--   'My First Story',
--   'New Author',
--   'fantasy',
--   'A sample story to get you started with the Story Manager'
-- );

-- The actual seeding will be handled by your application when users create their first story
-- This file is here as a reference for the data structure
